I was selected to participate in the
[11th Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF)](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/forum/11th-hlf-2024.html),
in Heidelberg, Germany, in September 2024.
The HLF is a networking conference where young researchers in math and CS can
meet laureates of the Abel Prize, Fields Medal, and Turing Award.
