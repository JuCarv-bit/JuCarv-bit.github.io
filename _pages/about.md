I am a first-year PhD student at the
[Language Technology Lab](https://ltl.mmll.cam.ac.uk/), University of
Cambridge, supervised by
[Prof. Anna Korhonen](https://sites.google.com/site/annakorhonen/) and
[Prof. Isabelle Augenstein](https://isabelleaugenstein.github.io/) (University
of Copenhagen) under the
[ELLIS PhD Program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc). My research interests are
in machine learning, natural language processing and explainable AI.

Previously, I was a researcher at the
[Visual Data Science Lab](http://visualdslab.com/) at Fundação Getulio Vargas
(FGV) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, conducting research in similar topics.
I hold an MSc in Mathematical Modeling (2024) and a BSc in Applied Mathematics
(2021), both from the
[School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en/school) at FGV.

In 2022, I was a visiting researcher at the
[Vision, Language, and Learning Lab](https://vislang.ai/) at Rice University,
Houston. Additionally, I have experience in applying computational methods to
address challenges in the legal domain.
