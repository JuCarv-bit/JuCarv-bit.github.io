I am an incoming PhD student in Computation, Cognition and Language at the
**University of Cambridge**, where I will be supervised by
[Prof. Anna Korhonen](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~alk23/).
I am a recipient of the prestigious Cambridge International Scholarship,
funded by the Cambridge Trust, and part of the
[ELLIS PhD Program](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc).

Currently, I am a researcher at the
[Visual Data Science Lab](http://visualdslab.com/) at Fundação Getulio Vargas
(FGV) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Since joining the lab in 2020, I have been conducting research in machine
learning (**ML**), natural language processing (**NLP**), and explainable AI (**XAI**).
I hold an MSc in Mathematical Modeling (2024) and a BSc in Applied Mathematics
(2021), both from the
[School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en/school) at FGV.

In 2022, I was a visiting researcher at the
[Vision, Language, and Learning Lab](https://vislang.ai/) at Rice University,
Houston, where I focused on developing research ideas in XAI.
Additionally, I have experience applying ML, NLP, XAI, and data visualization
techniques to address challenges in the legal domain.
